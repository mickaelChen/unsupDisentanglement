# unsupDisentanglement
Unsupervised Learning of Factorized Representation:
Learning to separate structure and texture without supervision, using an hierarchical version of InfoGAN and by leveraging priors induced by the choice of architectures and the structure of latent representations.


Generated images of chairs in 256x256 resolution, with fixed texture (on a column) or with fixed structure (on a row).
Not cherry picked.
